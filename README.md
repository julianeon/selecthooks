# About

I did this project as a revision of another one, to have a good model reference for a select form implementation using hooks in React (the original used classes). I also changed the lyrics and image to focus on Lizzo instead of Mr. Loaf.

This is about as minimal as it can be, without losing functionality. Try it - try refactoring it to be more compact, and see what happens. It demonstrates a basic React form about as well as it can, for its size.
     
# Files

See SelectForm.jsx (ignore the App.css file) for a good clear Select Form example, using hooks.

This is basically FlavorForm from the React docs pages, plus the logic to change the content on submit using the boolean "submitted", plus a refactoring using hooks.

See the CSS file for the typewriter effect, or to change the background image of Lizzo.
